RotEye is an innovative project designed to provide non-invasive detection of spoilage in fruits and vegetables by leveraging both RGB and spectral analysis. The system will utilize RGB analysis to examine the external characteristics of produce, identifying visual signs of damage and decay. Simultaneously, spectral analysis will be employed to assess the internal condition of the fruits and vegetables, determining whether they are rotten or spoiled without cutting them open. 

Each item features a QR code linking to inspection data, ensuring transparency for consumers. By integrating blockchain technology, we create a secure, traceable record of each product's quality history. This dual-analysis approach aims to enhance food quality monitoring, enabling consumers and suppliers to make informed decisions about produce safety, ultimately reducing food waste and improving supply chain efficiency.
